![Workflow illustration](illustration.png)

A workflow designed to drastically reduce overall token usage, extremely simple to use.

Beneath this simplicity is a tightly engineered agent orchestration system: a purpose-built documentation framework, strict responsibility boundaries, compact work-package communication, anti-stall and worker-replacement mechanisms, executor–tester repair loops, worker lifecycle management, and persistent project-state tracking. Everything is optimized to keep each agent focused on exactly what it needs.

> 💡 For lightweight tasks, it won’t overdo things. Light route is default.

> **ℹ️ Note:** this worflow is installed per project. Install it again when starting a new project.


## 1. Installation ⚙️

### Open Codex CLI or the Codex app from your project directory 

▶️ Send:

```text
Clone https://github.com/viettran-edgeAI/codex_workflow.git , then read @workflow_setup_guide.md and automatically perform the complete installation process described in it.
```

✅ Done. At this point, the basic installation process is complete. Codex will ask some additional optional advanced questions below to further optimize the current project.

## Configuration questions

You can answer the following questions or skip them. If you skip, the default settings will be used.

### 1. Workflow style and design principles (optinal)

Codex will ask about the project's workflow style and core design principles.
You can describe requirements such as:

- Prioritize modular design;
- Keep dependencies low;
- Do not change public APIs without prior approval;
- ...

### 2. Frontend project profile (optional)

The default workflow is designed primarily for backend work (Very heavily focused on testing). If the current project is a frontend project, Codex will ask whether you want to minimize testing, modularization, or similar requirements for the project. 

### 3. Power configuration

The default workflow is designed to save tokens for the ChatGPT Plus plan. Codex will ask if you want to enable each advanced option individually.

- Allow more subagents (currently a maximum of 5) and allow more than one `executor_sol` call.
- Set `executor_luna` and `tester` to the `max` model_reasoning_effort. Currently `xhigh`. 
- Allow subagents to send more detailed report packets to the main agent (event and final report are currently limited to 150 & 250 words).
- Allow subagents to retry more times when stuck/blocked before replacing them (currently 2). The new subagent will have to reload the context packet, but this will reduce the risk of getting stuck; consider this.

### 🔄 Restart Codex after installation

### 🧭 What is a workflow route?

This workflow has 3 routes:

- Light route: For light and medium tasks. Minimal context, no subagents, no workflow.
- Heavy route: For the deployment of heavy plans and tasks. Deploy subagents, full workflow. 
- Medium route: Coordinating multiple sub-agents for a medium-sized task can sometimes cost more tokens and be slower than letting the main agent perform the work independently. No subagents, full workflow. 

## ▶️ HOW TO USE

- Normally, for simple work or general Q&A, you don't need to do anything. `light route` is the default route.
- When starting or continuing a plan in progress, just tell Codex in the prompt: "

```text
use medium route / use heavy route. [your task description]".
```
> Codex stays on the selected route until you change it, so you don’t need to repeat it in every prompt.

> **⭐ Recommendation:** Assign very large and complex tasks to the `heavy route` to make the most of its capabilities and maximize token usage savings.

- When you want to end current session, clean up and update documents, commit, ...: 

```text
end this session. [tell Codex more details if necessary]".
```
`End-of-Session` handoff will be performed. This process updates the main document framework so that subsequent sessions can seamlessly continue the ongoing work.
> You can still continue the session after that message if needed. 

## ✨ Tips for further customization

* For very large codebases, you can ask Codex to modify the workflow to use a dedicated codebase management/navigation tool such as `Graphify` instead of relying on `project_progress.md`.

* If the Luna Max subagents feel too slow, you can enable `fast_mode` for them by adding:

  `service_tier = "fast"`

  to files such as `executor_luna.toml`, `tester.toml`, etc. 
  
> At the moment, the speed/usage multipliers on subscription plans are still x1.5/x2.5 rather than the x2.5/x2 in the API.

* Add custom subagents such as an `investigator` for researching solutions on the web, especially if your project is niche or highly specialized. Ask Codex to structure it consistently with the other subagents in this workflow and integrate it into `heavy_route`.

* Customize the `End-of-Session handoff` to suit your needs in `agent_docs/workflow/heavy_route.md` and `agent_docs/workflow/medium_route.md`.

## 🎁 BONUS · How this worflow works: a simple overview

> 📌 These things are about heavy route.

- Sol handles context, planning, task splitting, and supervision, while Luna subagents do the implementation. Each task is packaged into a small, self-contained work package with clear scope, context, and expected output, so each subagent only gets what it needs.

- Sol still reads the main documentations and the important parts of the codebase — that’s the manager’s job. In the medium and heavy routes, a single session-long explorer works alongside Sol as a read-only secretary and second brain, handling supplementary context such as tools, dependencies, external libraries, etc. It is not counted as a worker subagent. The goal is to minimize Sol’s token usage and keep it focused on the important stuff.

- For really hard tasks, executor_luna can get stuck. In that case, Sol can spawn an executor_sol as a fallback, or use it from the start. Right now, this worflow limits this to max 1 executor_sol.

- For handoff between sessions, project_progress.md and latest_session_work.md are managed by Sol as part of the main documentation structure. They’re there to keep long implementation plans moving smoothly across multiple sessions.

- ... etc.
